<h2> OSI Model -> Open Systems Interconnnection Model</h3>
<p>The Open system Interconnection Model is a seven layer conceptual model that characterizes and stadarizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system across the industry.
    Consider this: A Mac system wants to communicate with a Windows system, programmed differently, this would've been imposible. However, due to the Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI Model), the seperate systems are able to commmunicate and send data arcoss the internet.
    <p>
        The systems are able to do so via industry Standardized Protocals, from start to finish data gets passed along a seven layered stack with each layer doing something different.

<h2>The Open System Interconnection Layers </h2>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Layer Seven: Physical Layer</h3>
        <p>This Layer is the closest to the end user, the layer we see. Applications such as chrome, safari, firefox etc, protocals such as HTTPS, HTTP and DNS also pertain here (EX: https://www.cisco.com). Top most layer. </p>
        <p><b>Action:</b> Present as a communcation partener within the user inputs and the network its data travels through.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Goal:</b> Identifity communication partners and synchronizing communications, The application Network allows you to send, manipulate and retreve data using the network. This can be done via:
            <ul><li>Encapsulation & Decapsulation - Following the OSI Model Path (proceeding down the stack and up the stack again).
                <li>Same Layer Interation - Communiation between the application layers of the two different systems (Layer 7 to Layer 7 interactions).</li>
            </li></ul>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Layer Six: Presentation Layer </h3>
    <p>To be Continued...</p>

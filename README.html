<h2> OSI Model -> Open Systems Interconnnection Model</h3>
<p>The Open system Interconnection Model is a seven layer conceptual model that characterizes and stadarizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system across the industry.
    Consider this: A Mac system wants to communicate with a Windows system, programmed differently, this would've been imposible. However, due to the Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI Model), the seperate systems are able to commmunicate and send data arcoss the internet.
    <p>
        The systems are able to do so via industry Standardized Protocals, from start to finish data gets passed along a seven layered stack with each layer doing something different.

<h2>The Open System Interconnection Layers </h2>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Layer Seven: Applications Layer</h3>
        <p>This Layer is the closest to the end user, the layer we see. While Applications are not apart of the Application Layer, protocals such as HTTPS, HTTP and DNS also pertain here (EX: https://www.cisco.com). Top most layer. </p>
        <p><b>Action:</b> Present as a communcation partener within the user inputs and the network its data travels through.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Goal:</b> Identifity communication partners and synchronizing communications, The application Network allows you to send, manipulate and retreve data using the network. This can be done via:
            <ul><li>Encapsulation & Decapsulation - Following the OSI Model Path (proceeding down the stack and up the stack again).
                <li>Same Layer Interation - Communiation between the application layers of the two different systems (Layer 7 to Layer 7 interactions).</li>
            </li></ul>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Layer Six: Presentation Layer </h3>
        <p>This layers resposibility is to translate the data between the application/protocal and the network formats. Aswell as the ocasional file compression to improve the speed and effiecency for in which the data is transfered. Depending on if you're encapsulating data (working from Layer 7 to Layer 1) or decapsulting data (working from layer 1 to layer 7) on the stack, you might alos be encrypting or decrypting data at this level.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Layer Five: Session</h3>
        <p>Just as the name implies, a session is a duration and period of time in which a two devices had a connection, from first opened to close. This level ensures that the session stays open long enough to complete the data transfer just to then close it once the process is complete to avoid wasting resources.<n> Syncrhoniztion and Resyncronization techniques. <i>Syncrhoniztion points</i> are checkpoints inserted into the data stream, incase of a session interuption, <i>Resysncronization</i> allows the session to reset to a known state. A common example of this technique can be found when downloading a file, every xx mb or gb, a checkpoint is placed, incase of a session interuption, we can always refer back to the closest checkpoint.</n></p>
        <p><b>Action:</b> Sets Up, manages and terminates connections between the local host and the remote host.</p>
        <p><b>Goal:</b> Create & manage a connection between a local application and a remote application. Imbedded with a Syncrhoniztion and Resyncronization technique to improve data stream effiecency.</p>
